This is the 2nd eteration of the assignment/repository, fruit market.

The premise of the program is the same, with minor changes made to it concerning the output. On the other hand, the code side of the program had to go through many changes.
The point of this assignment was to get us familiar with loops and most importantly functions. In the first iteration of the program, everything was placed in void functions,
while in this iteration, the majority of them return a value.

One of the changes that the user can actually see is that once a transaction has been successful or unsuccessful, the user is prompted with an option to either contiue with 
another purchase or stop the program. If the user decides to stop the program, they are prompted with a message thanking them for their purchase. Furthermore, when the user decides on
a product to purchase, they can use both a capital or a lower-case letter (e.g "A" or "a" for the choice of Apples).
